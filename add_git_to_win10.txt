Guys, I found this stack overflow post on how to add git to the Windows 10 command line in PowerShell.



//-------------

Simply uncompress the latest "git for windows release" [1] portable archive (like PortableGit-2.7.2-64-bit.7z.exe [2]) anywhere you want and add to your PATH:

 c:\path\to\git;c:\path\to\git\bin;c:\path\to\git\usr\bin;c:\path\to\git\mingw64\bin


You will get git-bash.exe (recent 4.3+ bash based on msys2 [3]), but also 200+ unix commands right in your regular CMD shell.

Other Ideas:


- I've heard of something called "Git For Windows" that comes with a built in Git Bash that could be helpful. Will look more into it.

 - okay this is kind of a complex setup. I don't want to mess with it but I encourage you to look at it to see if you'd like to.
