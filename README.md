# Abstract:
<p>
Common Point of Sale systems are built for businesses to take and
manage orders, track labor hours, and manage menu options, but often
little attention is given to learnability, accessibility, and ease of use. The
Enhanced Access Point of Sale (EAPOS) allows for small businesses to
accommodate common impairments, such as color blindness, and offers
options for hand preference. This system includes a training mode which
allows new users to learn the system before they are required to do
anything in the store. This helps reduce the labor costs for training. The
FAQ section covers common functions that are easily forgotten due to
infrequent use. This Point of Sales System helps an employer to better
accommodate their new employees and to set them up for success when
taking orders with EAPOS. Whether you are experienced with Point of Sales
systems or are a first-time user, learning this system will be a breeze.
